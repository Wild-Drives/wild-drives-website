highlights:
- title: Rouen Cathedral 
  description: |-
    Marvel at France's tallest church. Standing at 151 metres, as tall as the Effiel Tower, you'll struggle to take it all in. The stained glass windows look magical in the evening light.
    
    Rouen has a facinating history and is well worth passing through on your adventure.

- title: Wild camping by a lake 
  description: |-
    Wake up with a forest on one side and a lake on the other. Across the Seine, you can see the sun hitting the medieval castle Château Gaillard. This translates to "Saucy Castle". Really.
