I'm excited to share some news with you all. We've recently teamed up with [Waterhaul,](https://waterhaul.co/) an amazing company that's dedicated to cleaning up our oceans and reducing plastic waste.

At Wild Drives, we're all about promoting sustainable travel and leaving a positive impact on the places we visit. We believe that everyone can play a part in preserving our planet and its natural wonders for future generations. That's why we've decided to partner with Waterhaul to bring their fantastic products to our customers.

Waterhaul makes sunglasses and litter pickers from discarded fishing nets and other ocean plastics. By using recycled materials, they're not only preventing these harmful plastics from ending up in our oceans but also creating sustainable products that look great too. And, best of all, each purchase comes with a lifetime warranty.


So, what does this mean for our Wild Drives adventurers? Well, every campervan hire now comes with a litter picking kit from Waterhaul. That means you can explore the beautiful countryside and coastal areas of the UK, pick up any litter you come across, and leave the place even better than you found it.

We know that many of our customers already have a deep respect for the environment, and we want to encourage everyone to take that extra step towards being a responsible and sustainable traveler. With our litter picking kits, you can make a tangible difference in the places you visit and help protect the wildlife that calls those places home.

We're thrilled to be working with Waterhaul and proud to be supporting their mission. Together, we hope to inspire more people to make eco-friendly choices and take action to protect our planet. 

Just one more reason to take our amazing electric campervans for a Wild Drive!

There's nothing better than crawling into a comfortable bed at the end of a long day of exploring. With this comfy bamboo bedding, you'll get a great night's sleep every night. Bamboo can wick moisture away from you twice as fast as cotton, which will keep you cool on those hot summer nights.

Both Wild Drives and Panda London are committed to reducing our impact on the environment. 

Panda London’s bamboo is grown in specially designated, sustainable forests. The Forest Stewardship Council monitors the farming process so that new bamboo shoots can grow and the forest can quickly be replenished.

All Wild Drives campervans conversions by [Love Campers](https://www.lovecampers.co.uk/) use sustainable materials. All wood is FSC certified. The vans include a solar panel for electricity. Natural Fibre insulation is used in the vans, using sheep's wool or hemp. And we have beautiful bamboo surfaces!

By hiring a Wild Drives campervan, you’re supporting more sustainable practices in so many ways.
