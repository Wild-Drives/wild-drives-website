At Wild Drives, we're always looking for ways to partner with companies that share our commitment to sustainability. That's why we're excited to announce our latest partnership with [Panda London,](https://pandalondon.com/) a company that produces sustainable bedding made out of bamboo.

Bamboo is the perfect material for our campervan bedding because it's both eco-friendly and luxurious. It's incredibly soft and breathable, which means you'll stay cool and comfortable throughout the night. And because bamboo is a fast-growing, renewable resource, it's much more sustainable than traditional bedding materials like cotton or polyester. It doesn’t rely on any pesticides or herbicides and drinks a third less water than cotton.

We're thrilled to be able to offer our customers the option to rent bamboo bedding during their Wild Drives campervan adventure. Here are just a few of the benefits you can expect.

There's nothing better than crawling into a comfortable bed at the end of a long day of exploring. With this comfy bamboo bedding, you'll get a great night's sleep every night. Bamboo can wick moisture away from you twice as fast as cotton, which will keep you cool on those hot summer nights.

Both Wild Drives and Panda London are committed to reducing our impact on the environment. 

Panda London’s bamboo is grown in specially designated, sustainable forests. The Forest Stewardship Council monitors the farming process so that new bamboo shoots can grow and the forest can quickly be replenished.

All Wild Drives campervans conversions use sustainable materials. All wood is FSC certified. The vans include a solar panel for electricity. Natural Fibre insulation is used in the vans, using sheep's wool or hemp. And we have beautiful bamboo surfaces!

By hiring a Wild Drives campervan, you’re supporting more sustainable practices in so many ways.
