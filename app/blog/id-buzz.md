The conversion of the interior was carried out by artisan van converters, Love Campers, based in East Sussex who are well known for their handcrafted, eco-conscious builds. 

The campervan features a space-saving slat bed alongside an attractive kitchenette, which includes a clever induction hob, a sink and a fridge. The interior will be made with a modern ply laminate and bamboo for a bright and retro feel. On top of its undeniable good looks, the van offers a powerful lithium battery and a solar panel system on the roof, making the camper functional as a totally off-grid experience without burning fossil fuels. 

All Wild Drives’ campers have been built by Love Campers in their environmentally certified workshop, with sustainable materials and processes. All the wood used is FSC certified, and the campers have natural fibre for insulation.

{% blogHeading2 "A unique experience" %}

The Volkswagen ID Buzz has been turning heads since its launch. With a classic profile reminiscent of the classic VW T2 camper, the ID Buzz marries old school charm with modern technology, not to mention the practicality of a MPV with the comfort of a premium SUV and the low running costs of an electric vehicle. 

With a WLTP range of 208 miles and a charging time of 5%-80% in 30 minutes, the ID Buzz is well-suited to long distance adventures.

What Car? named the ID Buzz as Best Large Electric Car of the year… and declared it as their Car of the Year for 2023. It is now available as a unique hireable campervan through Wild Drives.
