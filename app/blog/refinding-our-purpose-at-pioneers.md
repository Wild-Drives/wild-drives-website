Hey there, fellow adventurers! Today, I wanted to share a little story from November of last year as I was finishing the end of Wild Drives' first season.

Starting any business is tough, I knew that going in. But starting a business in an industry you have no prior experience with is setting a bit of a challenge for yourself. On top of that, being one of the first all-electric campervan hire companies in the world, there aren't many people you can learn from and understand how they've solved particular problems. You're making it up a lot as you go.

At first, I struggled with the financial pressure and stress that comes with entrepreneurship. Mid-way through the season my mental health really dipped, I felt tired and stressed all the time. 

I was washing the van in blistering heat, dealing with enquiries, sorting out booking paperwork, making a mess of the finances, as well as the whole marketing side of things.

There were loads of times when I wanted to throw in the microfiber towel and quit. I wasn't happy and I felt like I was doing everything badly.

But then something happened. In November I got accepted into the [BRITE Pioneers programme,](https://www.briteinnovation.co.uk/pioneers) which was run at Plus X in Brighton. 

<blockquote>Pioneers is a programme for innovative entrepreneurs and companies committed to scaling in a way that benefits both people and planet.</blockquote>

A two-day support programme designed for businesses that prioritize purpose and values. I wondered if this is what I needed.

I found myself in a cohort full of other business owners who were passionate about making a difference and changing the world for the better.

We heard from a range of guest speakers, including: 

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lowcarbonleaders.org/">Low Carbon Leaders</a> – Positive First Steps on Doing Business for Good</li>
<li><a href="https://www.watchthisspace.uk/">Watch this Sp_ce</a> – How to Tell Your Positive Impact Story Externally</li>
<li><a href="https://wearethejoyful.com/">The Joyful</a> – Identifying your Company Values Around Purpose</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mathys-squire.com/">Mathys and Squire</a> – Releasing Your Potential Value Through IP</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thegoodbusinessclub.com/">The Good Business Club</a> – Building a Purpose-driven Entrepreneurship Mindset</li>
</ul>

{% blogHeading2 "Why am I doing this again?" %}

Together, we talked about sustainability, values, and purpose. And this reminded why me why I started Wild Drives in the first place: **to protect the beauty of nature for future generations.**

When you're camping, you feel so at one with nature that it only makes sense to want to do all you can to protect it. That's exactly what Wild Drives is all about.

But perhaps the most important thing that I got out of the BRITE Pioneers program was the chance to connect with other business owners who truly understood what I was going through. 

As supportive as my family and friends had been, there's nothing quite like sitting down with someone who has built their own business from the ground up, who can visualise every drop of blood and sweat you've poured into your business.

I met some really inspirational people.

Lisa Baskott founded [2nd Line of Defence](https://2ndlineofdefence.com/) which focusing on recruiting female workers into the security industry. By increasing the number of female security staff, the business aims to create a safer environment for women and vulnerable people on nights out. Amazing!

Denis Byrne is CEO of [Sussex Prisoners' Families](https://www.sussexprisonersfamilies.org.uk/) which works in courts, prisons, and communities to help families navigate the criminal justice system. The community interest company offers advice, advocacy, information, and emotional support to those in need. Such important and impactful work!

{% blogHeading2 "Re-finding my own resiliance" %}

Coming out of Pioneers, which reminded me why I started this business in the first place, I felt like I had found a fresh reservoir of resiliance and motivation.

Wild Drives was never going to be an instant success in year one. I knew that going in. It's a long game and I'm firmly focused on making the steps that will get us there.

Thanks so much to the BRITE team for running a fantastic programme and all the speakers for sharing their expertise and insight!

{% blogHeading2 "Find your own support network" %}

If you're feeling lost or overwhelmed as an entrepreneur, you're not alone. There are loads of resources and support out there that can help. Find the local business communities and meet ups where you can talk to like-minded people who get you.

[Feel free to drop me an email.](/contact) I'm always happy to chat and share what I've learned so far.

And if you're looking for a way to get closer to nature while protecting it for future generations, maybe take [one of our campervans](/our-vans) for a spin.
