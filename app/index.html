        It was my first time driving a fully electric vehicle, and also my first time driving a camperized van. I was quite nervous and intimidated, but when Lewis dropped off the van he went over everything and I hit the road feeling more confident.

        Eve is a fabulous campervan with added bonus of being fully electric. So much thought has gone into every bit of detail in the van itself and the entire experience. We spent 6 wonderful nights travelling around Suffolk and Norfolk and Eve didnâ€™t fail to impress us along the way.
