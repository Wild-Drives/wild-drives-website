Done:
  - Established local dir structure
  - Exported all PNGs from Figma file, converted to JPGs
  - Created favicon(s) based on mark found in Figma file
  - Created GitHub repo
  - Created CodePen for homepage (https://codepen.io/haems/pen/wvmYgdY)

To-Do:
  - Determine appropriate photo dimensions
  - Color correct photos (if possible; check ownership and rights)
  - Convert images to WebP format
  
Ask Lewis:
  - How does he want the favicon to look in dark mode / light mode? Is the favicon meant to be B&W or color?
  - What do these pages look like on tablets and mobile viewports? Ultrawide display (is there a max-width?)
  - What parts of the UI need animation?
  - Is he set on Recoleta font? I'd need to license it. (https://www.myfonts.com/products/recoleta-complete-family-package-203125/licenses)
  - Lots of colors going on here. Not a question, just an observation. 
  - What happens when the user clicks the "Book Your Trip" link? I don't have the skill to code a webapp that could handle that.
