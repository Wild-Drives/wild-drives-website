### Done:
  - Established local dir structure
  - Exported all PNGs from Figma file, converted to JPGs
  - Created favicon(s) based on mark found in Figma file
  - Created GitHub repo

### To-Do:
- [ ] Determine appropriate photo dimensions
- [ ] Color correct photos (if possible; check ownership and rights)
- [ ] Convert images to WebP format
  
### Ask Lewis:
  - How does he want the favicon to look in dark mode / light mode? Is the favicon meant to be B&W or color?
  - What do these pages look like on tablets and mobile viewports? Ultrawide display (is there a max-width?)
  - What parts of the UI need animation?
  - Is he set on Recoleta font? I'd need to license it. (https://www.myfonts.com/products/recoleta-complete-family-package-203125/licenses)
  - Lots of colors going on here. Not a question, just an observation. 
  - What happens when the user clicks the "Book Your Trip" link? I don't have the skill to code a webapp that could handle that.


## Mon Aug 14 2022
### Done:
- Finished first draft on CodePen, tossed it into VSC
- Imported new fonts from Google
- Added color classes for fonts
- Adjusted alignment of .hero div
- Saved add'l images from the Figma file
- Created iconfont
- Fixed background issue with the green and purple squares -- used an SVG for the body background instead
- Imported more icons to iconfont
- Tweaked link styles
  
### To-Do:

- [x] Create CTA div for footer
- [x] Exempt / fix border-radius property for site-id.svg
- [x] Get favicon working (404)
- [x] Establish orange link style for links in <main>
- [x] Set background-color for social icons
- [x] Export SVG background (from Figma) for footer
- [x] Implement SVG background for footer
- [x] Export lightning bolt image (from Figma) for .hero
  
## Ask Lewis:
  - What color space is he using in Figma? sRGB or unmanaged? The colors look muddier in unmanaged. This will depend on browser as well -- we can't control which browsers / monitors users choose, so don't go too hard on this
  - Repost: How does he want the favicon to look in dark mode / light mode? Is the favicon meant to be B&W or color? Current favicon doesn't look so hot in dark mode
  - There are (at time of counting) 3 different email icons. Is this intentional?
