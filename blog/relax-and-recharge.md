# Relax and recharge

**Working title**

## The problem
The electric vehicle charging network is still maturing. Many EV charging points are stationed in motorway service stations, petrol stations, car parks, or fast food chains.

People who are required to wait for their vehicle to charge have limited options to spend their time.

## The solution
Relax and recharge is a community project where electric vehicle owners can suggest, review, and discuss charging points that have a positive impact on wellbeing.

This will include:
* Charging points on or near national trust sites
* Camping sites with electric vehicle charging points
* Wine estates with electric vehicle charging point
* Charging points nears beaches, rivers, and lakes
* Charging points at family-friendly activities like zoos

## Business model

Information is free for public users and non-profit enterprises

Businesses pay a monthly fee to feature their charging location to users.

Commercial businesses pay to use the information for profit
